# Automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python
Completed the course automate the boring stuff with python:
* Its not really a professionally written notebook instead I was having fun while doing this.
* Some files using the file module needs to be passed address or they will show error pass a string of your own choice.
* Some modules didn't work tried to solve the issues on stack overflow but to no avail.
* Removed some outputs as they were revealing some files on my pc.
* The commented lines can be removed. The only reason I made them a comment because I used a overwrite function later on or they were causing some issues.
